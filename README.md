# Neural NetworkðŸ’¡:
## 1 - A single layer perceptron (SLP) :Â 
. is a feed-forward network based on a threshold transfer function. 
### SLP is the simplest type of artificial neural networks and can only classify linearly separable casesÂ with a binary target (1 , 0).

## 2 - A convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) : 
### isÂ a network architecture for deep learning that learns directly from data.
### CNNs are particularly useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, classes, and categories.
### They can also be quite effective for classifying audio, time-series, and signal data.
