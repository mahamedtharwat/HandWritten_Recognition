# Neural Network 🧠 :
## 1. A single layer perceptron (SLP) : 
  * is a feed-forward network based on a threshold transfer function. 
  * SLP is the simplest type of artificial neural networks and can only classify linearly separable cases with a binary target (1 , 0).

## 2. A convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) : 
   * is a network architecture for deep learning that learns directly from data.
   * CNNs are particularly useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, classes, and categories.
   * They can also be quite effective for classifying audio, time-series, and signal data.
